Obviously that is relevant, and whole branches open up if he knows this. It'd be nice if I could easily save and restore games to the same spot in either case, but this doesn't seem to be readily available. I'd have to program it myself, which I'm not willing to do. Anyway, that burned 1-2 hours, so combined with the writing time, today was a pretty full day. Maybe adrenal mode from the trip is kicking in?
It could also be that my gut inflammation is less now that I've started to implement food rotation and increased raw veggie intake (via smoothies). It's gonna be hard to get it fully implemented, but so far, mom's been helpful. Got me 3 different kinds of ground meat for my jerky, and 3 diff kinds for making broth. Plus 9 different veggies for my 3 diff veggie smoothies. Still, this isn't enough food, so I have to figure something out for one more meal per day. It's stressful. Mom helps, but I feel like I can't ask too much of her. All this time, she still doesn't really understand gaps. Forgets what is and isn't a grain. It's too much to ask.
