[center][b]PREFACE[/b][/center]

Hi, everyone! I am a new author, and this is my first ChoiceScript game I'm putting out for review on the forum. It's a work of erotica, which I hope to find a way to publish. Any help on that would be greatly appreciated, as I've seen that the app stores may not take it. :-(
																																																																					
My intended audience is heterosexual males, and though I know that market is flooded, my hope is that my work will stand out for the following reasons:

[b]1.[/b] We guys are after sex and lots of it, but most stories and games do not have engaging storylines or much character development. Mine will.

[b]2.[/b] The female characters the protagonist meets in this game will not simply have meaningless sex with him right away. Don't worry; it will happen soon, very soon, but the leadup, the flirting, the seduction, and romance is most of the fun. 

[b]3.[/b] Many erotic games are about grinding to make money or some such before certain women can be seduced. I find that boring and want to focus on the story.

I hope to market erotic games like these under the brand name: [b]DeepErotica[/b][tm].

I prefaced this game with [b]SeductQuest[/b][tm], another trademark I want to register, to indicate right away to potential players that it's an erotic game set in a fantasy world. I have many other story/game ideas for this setting that would appear under both the DeepErotica and SeductQuest brands.

[b]Apology to those disappointed to find the main character can only be a heterosexual male:[/b] I'd like to write games supporting all genders and sexual orientation, but I simply cannot write well enough to pretend to be something I'm not. If there are any gay, straight female, or lesbian authors out there who want to co-author with me, let me know.
	
[b]Final Note:[/b] I will leave the more explicit sections of this game out for this Open Alpha test phase, but I'm thinking I'll put them back in when it reaches Closed Beta. I hope this game becomes popular, can be marketed, and makes Choice of Games and myself a lot of money. Mostly, though, it's a labor of "love," (or shall we say, "lust," LOL) as this is the kind of game I'd have loved to play on many a lonely night, yet alas, I could not find any. To we lonely men of the world, seeking higher quality erotica, I present...
