	You sit and think for a moment, watching Tamara walking away. Even if you don't want to join with her and become her apprentice, without a path to follow, it might be hard for you to find the knight.

*label followtamara
Tamara never even turns around, and soon she disappears into the forest foliage.

*label headtolair
Unable to track Juliette yourself, you head toward DragonKeep itself, keeping a good pace despite the upward slope, and by nightfall, you've greatly closed the distance. The mighty peaks that you gazed upon from afar now look almost close enough to touch, and there was no sign of Tamara all day, which you find quite uncharacteristic. Could she have finally given up on getting you to join her?
	
You find a good place to camp and pass an uneventful evening alone.

*goto_scene morning_alone

*label camp
Tamara starts walking again, and you see her studying the ground more intensely than usual. "It's odd," she says finally. "Now that Juliette is away from Banes, her pace has picked up to a degree impossible for one so heavily-laden with armor. It will be difficult, but we can still catch her, probably early tomorrow."

You groan inwardly, knowing this means a long day of hard trekking.

"That's not the worst part, though," Tamara goes on. "I suspect it means she's magically-aided, perhaps with Boots of Haste. The dragon senses magic, not to the same degree as negative emotions, but it will be able to locate her when she's probably still a mile out. We'll catch up to her before that, but convincing her to leave all her magic items behind might prove difficult. I hope your seduction skills are up to the task."
*page_break
After a few hours of forced march, as the sun begins to get lower in the sky, Tamara says, "Well, we made good time. Juliette is very close, and this looks like a good place to make camp."

Relieved that the day of heavy exertion is finally coming to a close, you look forward to a nice hot meal and well-earned sleep.

"You're my apprentice, so go gather a bunch of firewood," Tamara calls as she builds a little circle of stones for a firepit. "Then come back and rub my feet and shoulders."
*choice

*label protestwood
Rub her feet and shoulders?!? You understand that this is standard duty for apprentices, but in the current circumstances it seems like asking too much. Not only has it been a day of hard travel, your apprenticeship relationship with Tamara is hardly standard. In exchange for their complete servitude, apprentices can expect food, lodging, and years of training, culminating in the creation of a masterpiece and lucrative career. Will Tamara give you all this? You think not and tell her so.

"Are you sure you'll mind rubbing my feet and shoulders so much?" is all she says in reply, a slight smile on her face as, firepit completed, she spreads her bedroll.

Perhaps you might not want to protest so much?
*choice
	#Yeah, you might get lucky. Obey.
		*goto dotold
	#Continue to protest.

*label continueprotest
It's always nice to get lucky, but unless it's guaranteed, it's not worth being somebody's slave. "Look, Tamara," you say. "Can we ease up on the whole master-apprentice thing? We're on a hard journey, so shouldn't we help each other instead of me being your slave?"

"How about I help you gather firewood, but you still rub my feet and shoulders?" Tamara asks. Wow, how uncharacteristically reasonable. Maybe Banes really did make her see the light?

You and Tamara gather firewood and quickly amass a pile of wood to last all night.

Back at camp, the two of you stoke the fire until it's nice and stable. You like watching her poking a stick in and out, but when she sees you watching, she throws the stick into the fire. You like watching the stick burn and shrivel up a lot less.

*goto backandfoot

"What do we look like, a lovey-dovey couple?" Tamara says. "Come on."

She heads into the forest, picking up twigs for kindling.

Well, I guess that's that.

*goto firewoodtogether

*label dotold
You start gathering firewood, making a big pile that you have to keep coming back to, grumbling that it'd be much easier with two people because that way, one person can hold their arms out while the other loads it with sticks. It's much more efficient, but it seems like Tamara wants to treat you like a slave. She's probably back there doing her nails or something, but still, you know how master and apprentices work. The apprentice is expected to do whatever the master wants, keyword: whatever. To pass the time, you fantasize about what it'd be like if you had an apprentice, and you hope it's a hot girl like Tamara. You wonder what she was like when she was younger and just starting out, imagining all the ways she had to serve her master.

Finally, you have a pile that seems enough to last all night and bring it back to the campsite in only three trips. You wonder if Tamara will be impressed by how much you manage to carry each time, but nope, she doesn't even seem to look up, just points at the circle of stones she's made.

You start to knead her shoulders, and they're like steel springs, large for such a small-framed woman. You've got a good grip, but even so, you can barely squeeze them. It must be from all her training with the sword.

You try to sleep, but it's no use. You can't stop thinking about Tamara over there and how you want so badly to go climb into the bedroll with her. It's too embarrassing to masturbate, so you just lie there in agony. 

The minutes tick by slowly, the crackles of the fire marking time. One crackle. You're in agony. Two crackle. You're still in agony. Three crackle. Why did Tamara insist on this professional relationship??? Four crackle. Maybe I really should quit. Five crackle. That does it! I'm gonna go out into the forest and masturbate.

You're about to sneak away, claiming you had to "shake dew off your lily pad" if she happens to notice, but you're pretty sure she's asleep. She hasn't moved in a long time. 

You carefully roll over to your side and are just beginning to slooooowly push yourself up to a sitting position when you hear Tamara changing positions.

Unfortunately, you were facing the other way when you froze, so to see, you're going to have to roll over. You try to make it sound like you're just shifting in your sleep, but when you move, you hear all sound stop.

Carefully you slit one eye open, and you see Tamara on the other side of the fire staring straight at you. You almost scream but hold it in, composing yourself, and resume studying the situation. You can't see much more than her upper body, so it looks like she's just lying there looking at you.

After a few moments when you don't move again, she turns away and closes her eyes. The rhythmic sound starts again, and you see that she has both arms under the covers, hands perhaps between her legs. It looks like she's pulling something towards her again and again.

Soon, the tempo increases, and she begins to move a little, shifting the position of her legs. Her back arches, and her head occasionally rolls from side to side. Finally, a soft moan escapes her lips.

"I'm ready to rethink this master/apprentice thing," you hear her say.

You're up in a flash and by her bedside.

"That was fast," she laughs. 

You see that she's spread her legs, one leg almost completely out of her bedroll. Her lower body is completely naked, and you can nearly see her crotch. She peels back the covers, and you see that she's hiked her shirt up (she's taken off the vest and is just sleeping in the white shirt she wears under it) over her breasts. Her sword is between her legs, the pommel almost entirely inside her. She pulls it out and shows it to you.

"See," she says, "I have a phallic-shaped pommel." 

You see that it indeed looks exactly like a penis, carved from ivory.

"I don't know why, but it gives me comfort in battle to grip it. It's like hugging an old friend."

She slips it back into herself and starts to move it in and out again.

"I do this alone just about every night," she says. "But now I have you."

She pulls the pommel out again, slides the sword up her body, and starts softly licking the glistening shaft.

"Does it make you hard? Do you want to be inside me?"

You climb on top of her, your member already rock-hard. It's been so for the last half-hour! It feels so good inside her already worked snatch, and you begin to work it some more.

"I'm going to pee," she says, "Want to watch that too? Don't answer that."

She takes a few steps, turns around, and says, "That question was completely rhetorical. I don't want you to watch me pee. Seriously, do not follow me."

She turns and stalks off into the forest, shaking her head.

You wait a little while, then, as quietly as you can, get up and follow Tamara into the forest. It's dark, but the light of the moon guides your way. You can see her ghostly form making its way ahead of you.

She turns, sees you, but just keeps walking.

You keep following, and she keeps walking, eventually making a big circle. You arrive back at camp, and she climbs into bed.

"Good night," she says sullenly.

She's gone an awfully long time. Do you go check up on her?

You head off into the forest in the direction she was going when you last saw her, wondering if you'll even be able to find her in the dark. In a moment, you hear a sound and head toward it, and as you get closer, you realize that it's the leaves of a tree rustling rhythmically intermixed with the sound of deep breathing and soft moans.

You round a bend and come face to face with Tamara, but somehow she's grown taller. Her face is a foot above you! She's completely nude and hanging onto the branches of a tree, her legs splayed apart, each foot on a low branch. Her sword is staked into the earth at the base of the tree, and she's riding the pommel of it, the tree branches shuddering with each bounce.

When she sees you she screams and tries to leap off, but the sword's still inside her, making her fall backwards instead. She lands hard on her buttocks and scrambles backwards with her legs to get the sword out of her.

"What are you doing here!" she demands, and even in the dim light of the half-moon, you see her turning red.

	#"Um... shaking the dew off my lily pad?"
	#"You were taking way too long, so I thought something happened."
	#"Let me finish the job!"
		
"Shut up and get down here!" Tamara cries and grabs you by the waistband, pulling you on top of her. Her hands are scrambling to free your cock from your trousers.

"Get inside me before I change my mind," she says, finally pulling your swollen member free. 

She grabs your collar and pulls your head down for a passionate kiss while simultaneously wrapping her legs around your waist. Pulling with her legs and guiding your cock with one hand, it easily slips inside her.

"Ride me!" she screams.

*label bearnofollow
You wait for Tamara to return, and just when you think it's been so long something MUST'VE happened, you see her finally come back into camp. She's quiet and seems pensive. She stands by her bedroll for awhile, staring out into the night, then glances at you.

"You awake?" she finally says.

You pretend to be asleep, watching Tamara through slitted eyelids. She's standing by the fire, facing you fully now, just looking at you, wondering what she should do. After a minute or so, she tosses her sword on her bedroll, removes all her clothes, and is standing there naked, just in her knee-high leather boots.

She sidles over to you, steps over you with one foot, and kneels down, giving you a fantastic view of her pussy. Slowly, she moves it closer and closer to your face.

The woman's perhaps 5'6" tall, slender but muscular. She's wearing tan, skin-tight corduroy breeches that does well to show off her shapely behind. Her boots are knee-high, fashioned from expensive leather, and she seems to have a custom-made padded leather vest that's a beautifully deep red color. It must've cost a fortune. 

Her breasts are small enough that they show no cleavage in the vest's neckline, but they are still a shapely pair. Her arms are bare, but she's wearing doe-skin gloves that go up to her elbows.

She has a backpack and belt pouch, and by her side is a slender, wicked-looking sword. A crossbow is draped over her back with quarrels at the ready.

Her hair's chestnut brown and falls to her shoulders. Her eyes are a piercing green, and when she looks at you, her intensity makes you nervous sometimes. You don't know if she's going to snap at you or simply turn away in disdain.

Are you nuts? This woman is beautiful, and not only that, in a way, you helped her catch the faerie. Maybe she owes you at least an explanation, if not even... "gratitude." Wink, wink.

Are you sure?

I don't know why you just let her leave, but I suppose your reasons are your own. Maybe she gave you the creeps. Maybe you're afraid of hot women, but whatever your reason, you find yourself alone again and resume your journey.

*label journey
The path, no wider than an ox cart, continues its windy journey through Orlon Forest, rounding boulders and rock outcroppings here and there. You come to a point where the path takes a long detour, avoiding a small cliff with a drop of only ten feet or so, and you feel you could easily climb down, saving yourself a good ten minutes.

*choice
	#Climb down
		*goto climbdown
	#Stay on the path
		*goto staypath
	
*label climbdown
You easily climb down the small cliff, and nothing happens. No faerie waylaid you or anything. You didn't even slip. The path goes around simply because the road is used by farmers with their wagons, and you wonder just how serious the admonishment against leaving the path is.

*goto wagon

*label staypath
Better to be safe than sorry, for though you can see the path below, who knows what could happen. Not only might you slip, but you've heard that going off path is dangerous. The path's slope is gradual, and it shortly makes a hairpin turn, bringing you to the section you saw earlier.

*label wagon
In another ten minutes or so, you round a bend and see a wagon sitting in the middle of the road. It seems to be abandoned, its horse missing.
