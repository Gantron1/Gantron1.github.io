You remember well the moment your life changed forever. You were crossing the Corkish Mountains and just cresting the summit of Mt. Everhorn when the entire valley below became visible. You could see the walled capital city of the Kingdom of Zhan sitting in the middle of the plain, its magnificent spires thrusting skyward.

Then, from the northeast, the dragon came swooping in, and you saw its fiery breath, bright in your eyes, even from afar in broad daylight. The knights who rode out to meet it looked like tiny ants from your vantage point, and they were just as feeble against the dragon's might.

The dragon then rose to the highest tower, the one you knew housed the chambers of the princess Elsbeth, and with a sweep of its tail sundered its stone wall. You watched in horror as it reached in with its claw and extracted the princess, dressed in all her finery, and then the dragon was gone, returning to its aerie atop the far mountain range, DragonKeep.

Since that day, you made it your sole mission in life to rescue Princess Elsbeth, to succeed where so many have failed, and you now find yourself in the foothills below the great DragonKeep itself, having faced much hardship and difficulty.

"Are you here to slay the dragon?" says a voice, making you whirl around in surprise.

Before you, you see a woman, and how she managed to get so close to you without your hearing is a mystery.

*label look
The woman's perhaps five feet and six inches tall, slender but muscular. She's wearing tan, skin-tight leather breeches that do well to show off her figure. Her boots are knee-high, fashioned from expensive leather, and she seems to have a custom-made leather vest that's inlaid with an intricate pattern in silver and a beautiful deep red color. It must've cost a fortune, but it's also practical, affording more than a small amount of protection in battle.

Her breasts are small enough that they show no cleavage in the vest's neckline, but they are still a shapely pair. Her arms are bare, but she's wearing doe-skin gloves that go up to her elbows.

She has a backpack and belt pouch, and by her side is a slender, wicked-looking sword. A crossbow is draped over her back with quarrels at the ready.

Her hair's chestnut brown and falls to her shoulders. Her eyes are a piercing green, and when she looks at you, her intensity makes you nervous sometimes. You don't know if she's going to snap at you or simply turn away in disdain.

"Oh, hello," you say. "Fancy meeting you out here in the middle of nowhere. May I ask what you are doing so far from civilization and so near to the dragon's lair?"

"You can ask," the woman responds, not returning your friendliness but not hostile either. "The dragon's lair is exactly why I'm here. What of yourself?"

"How noble of you," the woman says. "Do you expect me to be impressed?"

She looks you up and down disdainfully.

"Well, at least you have a rope, so you must know the climb is difficult. Do you at least know that the dragon can hear each stroke of your hammer when you're pounding in your mountain climbing stakes? Do you know how it's watching all the time and even now, from perhaps a mile away, through tons of rock, it can probably sense us to at least some extent?"

In the days following the dragon sighting, you attempted to garner aid, both in the form of companions and information, to help you on your quest, but very little was forthcoming. Everyone with whom you spoke told you were crazy, and just about all had no helpful information. A ranger told you about the mountain and the need for ropes to climb it, and though he even taught you the rudiments of mountain climbing, he too attempted to dissuade you from your quest. So far, even the most skilled knights have not been able to best this particular dragon.

You heard it's a very old one, has roosted in DragonKeep for as long as anyone can remember, and over time, the kings learned that they could appease the dragon by offering it maidens, gold, and jewels. Each spring, a maiden and a large chest of treasure is brought to a special place for the dragon to collect, and this has reduced but not eliminated its depredations of the countryside.

Because of this, it was a great horror when it attacked the capital city itself, for that had not happened since the very first offering, 150 years ago.

It was surmised (by the sages who studied dragonlore) that the dragon was incensed by the audacity of the princess's high tower. A tradition had developed in Zhan where the higher a lady's bower, the more desired she was purported to be, and thus the princesses had the highest of all. The king, who loved this particular daughter to an unusually great extent because of her peerless beauty and charm, built for her a tower twice as tall as any had ever been built--and in so doing, unintentionally brought about the greatest tragedy the kingdom had ever known.

Such is the price of arrogance... a warning that you too, it could be said, have not heeded.

"Well, you may be a fool, but at least you're an honest fool," the woman says.

"My name's Tamara, and unlike you, I have no silly notions about rescuing the princess. I'm here for the treasure plain and simple. I'm a thief, master-class, my quest under full sanction by the thieves guild, for imagine the glory--the thief who robbed a dragon!"

Speaking thusly, she raises a clenched fist mightly before her and gazes purposefully off into the distance in imitation of a knight in victory. She smiles sheepishly at her own overenthusiasm and then continues, "I, in the noble tradition of thieves everywhere, plan to sneak in, and I know the location of the hidden entrance. I can't have you alerting the dragon to our presence, so I propose we work together. I will get you in without the dragon knowing, but after that, you're on your own. I steal the treasure, and you, if you're truly serious about your silly quest, can go rescue the princess, if she's even still alive. Is it a deal?"

*choice
	#"Okay, deal."
		*goto agree

Tamara exhales loudly in frustration. "Look," she says, "You're going to get yourself killed, and while I normally laugh at fools getting their comeupance, in this case, your blunder will interfere with my plans. Only the gods know why, but I'm offering to help you. If you refuse, you will have to promise to wait until I'm finished before making your own approach. Can we at least agree on that?"

*choice
	#Agree to wait.
		*goto agreewait
	#"What if I refuse?"
		*goto whatifrefuse
	#"Why don't YOU wait for me instead?"
		*goto youwait
	
*label agreewait
"That's the more stupid option, but okay," Tamara says. "You'll know I'm done because the dragon will erupt into a fury. They can sense if even a single gold piece is removed from their horde, and though I will wait until it's asleep, that will only buy me at most a few minutes. While it's chasing me, you might have time to rescue the princess, but probably not. DragonKeep was originally a dwarven outpost from the time of Thorkendal, but it has destroyed the approach. Both the hidden entrance and the original approach require a technical climb, so you won't have time. I suggest you wait longer."

"That won't work," Tamara says. "You'll have alerted the beast, ruining my ability to sneak past it. Look, it's not like I'm making this all up on the spot. I've been tracking you for the past few days, and I had a lot of time to think about how to handle the complication you represent. Frankly, my first thought, sad to say, was to simply kill you, but unfortunately, this close to the dragon's lair, it would sense us. We have to work together, or you agree to wait. There are no other options, so which is it?"
