A few minutes later, 
*if with_tamara
	Tamara pauses and thinks a moment.
	
	"Wait here," she says. "I need to shake the dew from my lily pad."

	She goes off into the forest by herself.
	
	*goto lilypad
*else
	with Tamara trailing along behind, you hear her say, "I need to shake the dew from my lily pad, but since we're not traveling together or anything, you don't have to wait for me or anything like that. Bye."
	
	She goes off into the forest by herself.

*label continuebyself
You feel yourself relax now that Tamara's not around, but your relief is short-lived. After only a little while, Tamara appears a little ways ahead of you. She glances at you, then at the ground.

"Their tracks are here," she says.

She starts heading on. "This way," she says, pointing up the slope. 

You inwardly groan.

"You were going fifteen degrees off their course," she goes on. "Now that there's no path anymore, and your tracking skills are non-existent, don't you think you should man up and just accept that you could use my help?
*choice
	#"Fine," you say, just to shut her up.

*label stealth
You wait a moment, then follow her, being as quiet as you can. You marvel at how quietly she's able to walk, never rustling leaves or grass, nor stepping on any twigs. Maybe she really is a master thief like she claims? You do your best to move quietly as well, and you are, for the most part, successful. At least, Tamara doesn't show any sign that she knows you're following her.

Eventually, she stops, and you watch her from behind a tree a few dozen yards away.

She fumbles with her belt a little, then squats on the other side of a tree which partially obstructs your view of her. You can't really see much more than her left arm and shoulder.

*label creep
You, creep, begin to creep in a small arc in order to see more of her body, but you just begin to see the back-left side of her head when a twig snaps underfoot. Tamara is up like a shot, her pants already up, belt fastened, and her hand whips to the pommel of her sword.

When she sees that it's you, she signs irritably. "What in the world do you think you're doing???" she hisses.

*choice

"It wasn't just an excuse to watch me make water?" Tamara asks, her eyes narrowed suspiciously.

"No, of course not!" you say.

"Then... I guess I'll let you off the hook this one time," she says. "I'd have done the same thing, but if you do it again, I'll show you no mercy."

*goto camp

*label looklily
"Oh my gods," Tamara cries. "Do you really expect me to believe that? Look, you and I have a professional relationship, so I expect there to be NO funny business between us. Understand?"

She puts something she was holding back into her belt pouch and stomps off, making as much noise as a normal person stomping around in the woods. I guess when she's mad, she no longer uses her thieves step.

"I thought so," Tamara says. "You men are all alike. Look, you and I have a professional relationship, so I expect there to be NO funny business between us. Understand?"

You hurry to catch up.

"I'm sorry, Tamara," you say. "It won't happen again."

Tamara's face softens, and she smiles. "Oh, it's all right," she says. "I'm not a priss like I'm sure your princess is going to be. Just don't do it again, or I'll cut something off."

*goto camp

As soon as you're in range, Tamara slaps you on the cheek.

Tamara's face becomes a mixture of disbelief and fury.

"How dare you!" she cries. "That's it. We're done. You go rescue your princess by yourself."

She stalks off into the woods.

*choice
	#Catch up to her.
		*goto slapcatchup
	#Good riddance.

You quickly catch up to Tamara, but she refuses to acknowledge you and continues to stomp her way through the forest.

"What part of 'we're done,' don't you understand?" Tamara spats. "Stop following me or face my wrath!"

*label slapkeepapol
*set tamara_respect %+20
Finally Tamara stops walking, but she still doesn't acknowledge you or your apologetic words. Instead, she just stares at the ground, shaking with anger.

It takes a long time, but it seems she finally calms down.

"Okay," she says. "Let's forget this ever happened. We need to work together on our assault on DragonKeep, and that's the only reason you're not dead right now."

She holds out her hand.

"Shake it before I change my mind."

*fake_choice
	#Shake it.
		
Tamara smiles and even seems to almost giggle now, as if now that it's over, the whole incident seems silly to her. She shakes her head, rolling her eyes.

"Come on. We've wasted enough time, and if the dragon didn't know we were here before, it does now."

You ask her if this changes things.

"Yes, but it's not enough for us to abort the endeavor," she replies. "I know what I'm doing."

*goto camp
		
*label slapnothing
"Why are you following me!" Tamara cries and slaps you again. She grips you by the shoulders and shakes you, overcome with rage, and slaps you again. She stares into your eyes, utterly consumed with the emotions roiling in her body, not knowing what to do with them, and then she kisses you. Hard. Her hands snake around you and pull you into a bone-crushing embrace, and her pelvis is pressing hard into yours.

*choice
	#Kiss her back.
		*goto slapkiss
	#Push her away.
		*goto slappush
	
*label slapkiss
You wrap your arms around Tamara just as passionately, returning her kiss with equal intensity.

She moans as her kisses come fast and hard, but then suddenly she pushes you away, making you both fall backward a few steps.

"No," she says, panting to catch her breath. "We mustn't. We're here for one reason only, and that's the dragon."

*choice
	#Agree.
		You know it's for the best. She's here to rob the beast, and your quest is to rescue Princess Elsbeth. To get involved romantically would complicate matters too much.
		
		You nod reluctantly, and silently the two of you resume your journey, neither speaking for a long time.
		
		*goto camp
	#Ask why you can't have a relationship and continue your quest at the same time.
		"Because," Tamara says, "My aid to you extends only to the point of our entrance into the lair. After that, we part ways, each left to their own fate. I still think you're going to die in your foolish quest, and even if you succeed, having the princess, you'll have no more need of me."
		
		Chastened by her frank honesty, you can do nothing other than nod in silent acknowledgment of her hard truths. Silently, the two of you resume your journey, neither speaking for a long time.
		
		*goto camp
	
*label slappush
"What are you doing, Tamara?" you cry, startled by her sudden, amorous transformation.

Your push causes her to take a few step back, and when she recovers her balance, she smiles disdainfully.

"You weak man," she sneers. "Am I too much woman for you?"

*choice
	#Be reasonable: Tell her that's not it. You're just trying to maintain a professional relationship.
		*goto slapreasonable
	#Get angry: Tell her no one calls you weak and gets away with it.
		*goto slapweak
	#Change your mind: Tell her she's not too much woman and kiss her.
		*goto slapkiss2
	
*label slapreasonable
Tamara tosses her head to one side disdainfully. "That's a noble idea," she says, "But I still think you're weak."

She turns and starts walking away.

"Come on," she says. "The dragon won't wait forever."

In a few moments, Tamara stands and begins returning the way she came, adjusting the pouch on her belt while she walks, seeming completely oblivious to your presence. She's coming right towards you.

"That's it?" Gabriella asks in disbelief. "You hide to watch me pee and think just an apology is good enough?"

Gabriella stares at you for a long time, thinking. Finally, she seems to have come to a decision.
	
"All right," she says. "I'll let you off the hook this one time, but if you ever do anything like that again, I'll cut something off."

You can't see much from this distance, but it seems like she really might just be "shaking the dew off her lily pad." 

In a short while, you see her stand and pull her breaches back on. She refastens her belt, taking her time, totally oblivious of your presence. Then she starts heading back and is coming right towards you.

	You wait, and you wait. It always seems a long time when you're waiting.

	Finally, she returns, sees you, and says, "Good. I'm glad you didn't follow me in there to rape me when I had my pants down."

	She smiles at her joke, and you realize it's the first time you've seen her smile. She's pretty when she does that, but the smile's woefully shortlived.

	In a few minutes, she finally comes back.
