Tamara wakes you up just before dawn by nudging you in the ribs.

You notice you have morning wood, so it's just a simple matter of slipping into her and...

"There's no time for that," Tamara says. "We need to get up early to catch up with Juliette at her special morning time."

"No we can't," Tamara says, already up and getting dressed. She kicks you with her foot.

The crisp morning air refreshes you as you follow behind Tamara, resuming your march uphill. Your muscles are a bit sore, but not too bad.

You and Tamara share your smoked pork and beef jerky while walking in silence and the morning mist. All you hear is the regular crunch-crunch of the pine needles under your feet.

After perhaps an hour, the dim, near darkness gives way to rosy dawn, but the chill lingers in the air. Tamara motions for you to be quiet, and carefully, the two of you creep from tree to tree until finally Tamara says, "There she is."

You peer around the tree the two of you are hiding behind and see Juliette still sleeping next to a small fire.

Tamara nudges you. "Seduction time," she whispers. "Go!"

You get perhaps ten feet from Juliette when she bursts awake and leaps to her feet. Out of the corner of your eye, you see Tamara smack herself on the forehead and mutter something about your stupidity to herself.

Juliette's still in her armor, and apparently even sleeps in her helm. She whips out her sword but her shield is still propped against a log near the fire.

"State your business, cretin," she demands, but already she's advancing on you.

Tamara shows herself, causing Juliette to cease her advance.

"We come as friends," Tamara says.

"Why send your compatriot forward in stealth then," Juliette says, eyes narrowed suspiciously as she retreats a few steps and picks up her shield.

"Yeah, why?" Tamara says, looking at you.

"And you thought you'd keep me company, I presume?" Juliette says disgustedly. "I should slay you where you stand."

Tamara steps in front of you and shoves you behind her. "I apologize for him," she says. "He means well but gets crazy ideas sometimes. Why just yesterday, he was... Well, never mind that. Suffice it to say he did many unusual things yesterday.

"You met Banes?" Juliette asks. After a pause, she says, "And he said WHAT???"

"Yes, we met Banes," Tamara says, stepping in front of you and shoving you behind her. "But, noooo, he did not say anything of the kind. You'll have to forgive my compatriot here. He confuses fantasy with reality.

"We met Banes shortly after Chardell," Tamara says. "He told us of your quest, and as it is our quest as well, we endeavored to catch you. Perhaps we can join forces?"

Juliette looks the both of you over.

	"I decline," she says. "Leave now, and I will not consider us enemies."

	"I thank you for your offer," Juliette says, "But I'm sorry. I must decline. However, perhaps you would care to join me in breakfast? Even here, in the wilds, we can, after all, enjoy civilized behavior."

"Ha!" Tamara snorts. "Many of my compatriots have served your lords as spies for generations."

"Not I," Juliette retorts. "I follow the old ways, those of honor and chivalry."

"Is that the real reason why your brother outshines you?" Tamara asks darkly. 

Juliette blushes and turns away.

"You know nothing of my family business," she says haughtily as she walks away.
