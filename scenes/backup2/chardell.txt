"By the way, you say, "Perhaps it would be good for me to tell you that just before I met you, while scouting, I saw from a distance two people and their campsite. We will likely catch up with them soon."

"Was one a woman in armor and the other an old man?" Tamara asks, her tone of voice making it sound like she already knows all about them.

"Why yes! How did you know?" you exclaim.

"I've been tracking them the same as I've been tracking you, of course, dummy. How could I know about you but not them?"

"You saw them already, then? Have you talked to them?"

"No, of course not. They're ahead of you."

"But how then did you know what they look like?"

"By the gods, how stupid can one person be?" she spats. "Women's feet are smaller proportioned than men's, but leave a heavy indention in the earth. The way the man shuffles along tells me he's elderly. I can tell a lot of other things about them from the sign they leave as well, and... I know what they do every morning. What did you see?"

"Well, since you already know, I suppose there's no reason not to tell," you say. "It seems the old man pleasures the woman."

"It must be nice having that service available at your beck and call, isn't it?" Tamara laughs. 
*label juicy
"It's always the same. She leans up on something, and he kneels before her. It takes, maybe, three minutes, and she tries not to move or cry out very much."

"How in the world do you know all that?" What she described is exactly what you saw!

"I told you," Tamara says. "I read the signs. It's all there if you know how to look. Anyway..."

Tamara signs dejectedly. "I'm going to have to help them as well, for a knight will certainly bungle a stealthy approach if left on her own. She seems to like a man's touch, so it'd be nice if you flirt with her and otherwise do what you can to make a good impression."

"What?" Tamara says and punches you on the arm. It wasn't hard enough to injure you, but it did hurt. "Didn't we agree you'd do everything I asked? I even asked nicely. That's the last time I'm ever doing THAT! 

"Some people... show any kindness, any kindness at all, and they see it as weakness. 

"Iron hand... that's what my mother always used to tell me, 'Rule with an iron hand.' 

Look, we HAVE TO get them to cooperate. I know the area. I know this dragon. I have devised an intricate strategy that covers all contingencies, and the presence of bumbling fools, which it seems I just had to have the misfortune to encounter, requires... REQUIRES their cooperation. It's IN THE PLAN. It's the only way. Will you do it or not?"

		*goto sarcasm
	
*label not
"Not?!?" Tamara cries, eyes bulging out in disbelief. "Okay, that's it. I'm not helping you anymore. You and the idiot knight can go get yourselves killed, and I'll be sitting there laughing. This is actually in my plan too. If the bumbling fools become even bigger fools by not accepting my help, I let them distract the dragon, which makes things even better for me. See how masterfully crafted my plan is? I just be a little snarky, and it's like pulling a puppet's strings--you go and do exactly what I really wanted all along. Muhahahahahahahaha!"

Tamara erupts into maniacal laughter and can't stop for several minutes.

You sit down.

Tamara turns around, confused. "What are you doing?" 

"I am sitting here, and I won't get up until YOU go first. Is THAT in your plan?"

"What?!?" Tamara says, aghast. "Wait, no, yes. It actually IS in the plan. See?"

She walks off, and soon, you're by yourself.

It feels like a long time, but it's probably only a minute or two before Tamara comes back. You suppress a smile, thinking you've won, but then you see that she herself is barely suppressing a grin. Oh, no... What is she up to now?

She sits in front of you and just stares at you.

"What?" you say after the silence gets unbearable.

"Oh, nothing," Tamara says. "I was just sitting here thinking about what might be happening to the princess."

She stops talking, and it's silent again, except now you are worrying about the princess. Tamara stares at you, doing nothing, saying nothing, her face expressionless.

	Tamara lays on her side. "This is me being the dragon," she says, and she starts imitating a dragon lying on its pile of treasure. "Oh, look at all my pretty baubles," she goes on, looking around at the imaginary pile of treasure under her. "Oh, and here comes the princess," she says, glancing over to one side. "What shall I do with her?"

"Good," Tamara sighs, her irritation dissipating. 

She walks in silence a moment, and then a smirk appears on her face.

"No guarantees?" she says, still smirking. "That's fine. My plan covers your inadequacies, whatever they are. It might be this--"

She holds her hands in front of her, palms facing each other around seven inches apart and then moves them closer to more like three.

"Or this--"

She holds her hand up, fingers together, and then makes it droop flaccidly.

"Or..."

She goes on making all kinds of hand gestures, some of which you understand and some you don't. Obviously, she's an encyclopedia of male inadequacies, but you refrain from speculating as to how she might've acquired her wealth of knowledge. (Because it's obvious. Sadly.) Most of them don't apply to you, but you stop looking just in case.

"Why yes," Tamara says. "That's exactly what the plan says."

"Like you really thought of all that beforehand..."

"Well, since you already know all about it, I don't need to tell you all the sordid details, do I?" you say.

In a little while, the path descends into a small wooded valley, and at the bottom, you find a small clearing with a large stake in the center. 

"This is Chardell," Tamara whispers softly.

You recognize the name. Chardell is the place where the annual sacrifice was made, and you realize with horror that over a hundred maidens were in turn chained to that stake to await the dragon. You wonder how many are still alive and of those, how many will let you boink them.

Some of the surrounding trees are charred, and the burned areas are higher up with the lower branches untouched. It's obviously from dragonfire, but why? 

"Sad isn't it?" Tamara says, gazing at the now empty clearing. 

"Yes," you agree, glad to see that Tamara has a softer side.

"Yeah," Tamara says. "A hundred and fifty chests of treasure, now just sitting up in DragonKeep doing nobody any good."

"You sentimental fool," Tamara snaps. "It could easily have been me being sacrificed, so yeah, I have thought about it. A lot, but you know what? In the end we all have to die sometime, some just sooner rather than later. These girls at least lived long enough to see the flowering of their womanhood, something not everyone does."

She walks up to the stake and spits.

"To hell with you, dragon!" she says. "And to hell with all the kings who fed you our daughters."

Tamara inspects one of the charred trees.

"This is old," she says. "It must've happened a hundred years ago. I guess people wised up after that."

"But what happened to cause it?" you ask. "Was the dragon displeased for some reason? Or perhaps it was from a battle as some would-be hero attempted to rescue that year's sacrifice?"

Tamara laughs. "More likely the battle was with a band of thieves after the treasure... and the girl too, I suppose."

*label cross
Tamara crosses the clearing and jerks her head to indicate that you should follow.

"No, he feeds them tenderly, and DragonKeep is full of white-haired old ladies," Tamara spats sarcastically. "Regardless of what it does with them, I'm sure it's not fun, so let's waste no time."

"There's no path from here on, for obvious reasons," she says. "Only heroes and fools pass this point, and it remains to be seen which we are."

"The foothills get steeper past this point," Tamara says. "I'd estimate that if we travel at your speed, we'll reach the foot of the mountain sometime tomorrow, though I could make it on my own in one day. I hope you're up for it. Try and keep up, but don't let yourself get too tired. There probably won't be any hostile encounters here, but it's always good to maintain vigilance."
*page_break Onward!
You make your way up the rocky slope, making slow but steady progress. You have a hard trek ahead of you today, but you're up to the task. Tamara, carrying a lighter load, wearing more nimble boots, is having an easier time of it, but even she is a bit breathless. Because of this, she's not talking much, and you enjoy the respite from her normally constant assessment and advice. You can't help but notice the sheen of a thin layer of sweat on her skin and how her chest heaves a bit when she breathes--she's attractive when her lips aren't moving! 

"We're catching up to them," Tamara says, panting a bit. "The knight is weighed down by her armor, but judging by the tracks, it's really the old man who's holding them back." You look down but can't for the life of you see any sign or tracks.

At a particularly steep point, Tamara grabs onto the trunk of a small tree and reaches back, offering you her hand to help hoist you over the steep part.
