It's a pleasant day, and you fill your lungs with air, enjoying the sensations of having a body again. You assume that since you materialized on a path facing a certain direction, walking forward on the path is what you're supposed to do. You congratulate yourself on your brilliant deduction.

After a few minutes, you round a bend, and...
*page_break
You see a faerie. Just standing in the middle of the road, facing you, hands on her hips, legs splayed, looking as if she were waiting for you.

"Hi!" she says and flits up to eye-level, a few feet in front of your face. "My name's Ella."

		Of course, of course. You're a good boy, aren't you! 
		
		Well, judging by her size, you figure you've swatted flies more menacing than she is. Plus, she seems really friendly! She seems too innocent to fake that, but on the other hand, don't people warn you to stay away from faeries, to stay on the path, and never, ever accept invitations to Faerie Feasts? Maybe they really are dangerous even if they seem so harmless, not to mention HOT!

		Are all geeks as scientifically-minded as you are?

Ella's less than a foot tall, glowing green, wearing a green dress, and flitting about on a pair of what look like dragonfly wings.

Now do you shake her hand?

The woods and path look harmless enough, but you take a moment to look around, for after all, you have no idea where you are. For all you know, there could be a pit trap right in front of you or the forest infested by snares.

Well, there is no pit trap. No snares either. No one is hiding nearby in ambush, at least not one who has not yet sprung out at you...

...and then something DOES spring out at you!
*page_break
It's a faerie, a little green faerie, and she goes whizzing by you at near super-sonic speed. She then screeches to a halt a few feet in front of your face.

"What?" she asks, trying to appear nonchalant. "Were you expecting a pit trap instead?"

"How is that possible???" the faerie exclaims, and her eyes widen as she takes in your comparatively enormous size. "Anyway," she says, shaking her head as if to throw your outrageous suggestion out of it, "I was just looking for you! I knew you where here, and now I found you. My name's Ella!"

You reach out and shake Ella's tiny little hand, careful not to break it. 

"Now that we are properly introduced," she says, "I have a proposition for you!"

Her voice is like little bells tinkling.

Strange. That should remind you of something. Tinkling... bells... TinkleBell... Tinkerbell?

In this world, there is no Disney, and your memory of Tinkerbell and all things of your old world gradually fade from your mind. Soon you are 100% a denizen of this new world. You are carrying a sword and wearing a breastplate made from reinforced leather. You're a traveling warrior, and you even remember the village where you're from, that you left home to seek your fortune.

"Well?" Ella says. "Do you want to hear my proposition?"

"Oh, um, yeah..." you say, startled out of your reverie.

The faerie's face breaks into an overjoyed grin. "I am so happy!" she cries. "I will tell you something that you now do not know but that I know you will be happy to know, and all I ask in return is that you give me... satisfaction."

"Gold?!?" Ella cries so loudly it startles you. "Don't you know anything about faeries? What use do we have for that? We're not leprechauns or dragons, Silly! No, faeries just want to have fun, and though frolicking and feasts are great fun, sometimes, like you humans, we just want to have sex."

*goto stammersmall

"Oh, how can you really not know?" Ella says, her eyes narrowing mischievously. "I think you know!"

"Could it be... sex?" you ask.

"Of course, sex!" Ella laughs.

"But..." you stammer, "How? I mean... you're so small, and I'm... well, not hung like a horse, but you know, pretty big as far as things go, I think, and anyway, much too big for someone your size..."

"Oh, I'm sure it is," Ella says, staring for a moment at your crotch as if undressing you with her eyes. "That is too bad... but what I was thinking was... well, you see, I have always dreamt of riding a giant, slippery, red, quivering..."

*goto yourtongue

*label yessatisfaction
"Yay!" Ella rejoices, turning loop-de-loops in the air.

Red-faced and breathing hard from the exertion, she stops and hovers again a few feet in front of you. 

"I have always dreamt of riding a giant, slippery, red, quivering..."

*goto yourtongue
	
*label moresize
"You are my size," the faerie says, her face deadpan. Only after a pause that's a little too long does she burst into laughter. "You, Silly!" she giggles. "Faerie males are all right, but I've always dreamt of riding a giant, slippery, red, quivering..."

*label yourtongue
She stops speaking and just stares at you, one hand pressing between her strongly clenched legs.

Finally, she's able to go on, "Oh, you know what I mean. Your tongue! Your tongue! Will you? Please? Please?"

Ella's face breaks into a giant grin. 
*label flytilt2
You tilt your head back, open your mouth, and stick your tongue straight up as far as it will go, and she begins to float over to it, her legs spread so wide that the skirt of her little green dress rides up and shows all. Gently she descends onto your tongue, mashing her crotch into it. Her eyes close, and she exhales, her dream coming true.

Sometimes she bounces up and down, and other times she gyrates her hips, but all the while she seems to be fully enjoying herself, moaning with pleasure, eyes closed.

Gradually, her motions become faster and more frantic, her cries becoming more intense. 

*page_break

"Oh, what is so good about money that you humans cover it so?" Ella pouts. "Is it because it's shiny and pretty? I suppose gold does have a nice shine, but we faeries already glow, don't we? I don't want money!"
*goto tonguechoice
	
*label approach
"Oh yes! Oh yes!" the faerie screams, so happy her wish is about to be fulfilled. Hovering in midair, she leans back until she's horizontal and spreads her legs, giving you full view of her tiny vulva which, despite its tiny size, looks exactly like a human girl's. She waits like this, eyes already closed.

*label givewants
The faerie is wearing tiny little olive green slippers, but otherwise, her legs are completely bare under her dress. Daintily you grasp each of her tiny ankles between your thumb and forefinger to pull her hovering, supine body toward your salivating mouth. 

Ella inhales in anticipation and exhales, "Ahhhh..." when your tongue slides between her thin little legs. Compared to her body, your tongue is so large, it covers her entire pube and half her thighs if you push it forward. 

*label givewants2
She begins undulating her body in a mesmerizing wave motion human women are incapable of performing with anything approaching the same level of grace. It's as if a current from deep beneath the sea were made manifest right there in front of your nose.

"Yessss... Just like that..." she murmurs approvingly as you begin darting your tongue forward and back, dabbing at her sex again and again. "Oh... Ohh... Ohhhhh...." Soon Ella begins to emit long slow moans that echo into the surrounding forest, and you can tell the pleasure is building in her body to unbearable levels. 

"Harder... harder..." Ella begs, and though at first you worry about hurting her, her cries of pleasure urge you on. You begin to dab at her harder and faster until your tongue is moving at a furious pace. You alternate the dabbing with stronger pushes, really mashing it against her entire crotch as if trying to force your tongue inside her though, of course, it's far too big.

Finally, Ella explodes into a little crescendo of ecstasy right in front of your face.

*page_break
Ella lies on top of your face for a long while, and you feel her little body breathing heavily. Finally, she sits up and opens her eyes, slowly lifts off and hovers in front of you again. She smooths the skirt of her dress and makes herself look like a proper faerie again.

"Thank you," she says. "Oh, thank you so much!"

You worry that she might fly away and forget about her part of the deal, but after grinning at you gratefully for a bit longer, she speaks again.

"The information I promised," she begins, her face still rosy, her voice still a bit breathless, "Is that further ahead, on this very path, is a chance for a strong warrior to rescue a damsel in distress, and for which she will be very grateful. However, if not a strong warrior ye be, this encounter ye best avoid."

After speaking, Ella arranges her hair a bit, as it had become slightly disheveled in your recent merry-making, but now she's all sparkly again. 

"Good luck, friend human," she says, rising up into the canopy of leaves. "Know that you are now... friend of the fae." And with that, she's gone, disappeared into the forest, leaving only the gentle rustling of the leaves, almost as if your tryst had never been.

You tricked her! While Ella's eyes are closed, you quickly catch her in a bag. 

"What? Hey!" you hear her little muffled faerie voice cry.

You feel her thrashing about in the bag but hold it tightly closed. Somehow, however, she manages to get out.

"Don't you know you need a magic bag to catch faeries?" she says. "You are a bad human!"

She flies away, and you are alone again, only the twittering of birds to keep you company.

"Are you going to let me ride your tongue for real this time?" she asks, eyes narrowed.

You assure her you will, that catching her in the bag was just a joke.

"I knew I needed a magic bag," you add, hoping she believes it.

She seems to, for her face brightens. "I knew you weren't a bad human," she says.

Never one to tarry when a damsel in distress is waiting, you throw caution to the wind, and in only a few minutes or so, you hear the sound of men's voices mixed with the shrieks of a young woman coming from somewhere off the path.

You break into a trot, heading into the thicket, the sounds of distress growing louder with each step.

"We got a real beauty this time, eh, Harod?" you hear a man laugh.

"I'll say," you hear someone, perhaps Harod, retort.

"Me first!" you hear a third man exclaim.

Your pace quickens, despite the rough terrain, and soon you burst into a small clearing several dozen yards into the woods away from the road. There are three slovenly-looking men kneeling, surrounding a young peasant girl on the ground, struggling to escape. Her dress is torn in several places, one breast already exposed, and the men are rapidly ripping the rest from her body.

"Oh, please, kind sirs," she begs, "Let me go. Let me go, please!"

You are upon them before they know it and quickly behead the nearest man. The other two scramble away in a comical display of gasps of horror and the pulling up of breaches. One is grabbing for his belt which has his short sword (really just a long knife), while the other manages to get to his feet and run. You believe you can easily kill one or the other but not both.

The girl is already scrambling away herself but trips on the dress already half off her body. She falls and gashes her shin badly on a sharp rock, screams in pain and then subsides into sobbing.

"Are you all right, miss?" you say in your most chivalrous voice.

"Yes, oh yes, thank you, kind sir," the girl says through her sobs which quickly turn from those of terror to relief.

You're not too good at mushy stuff. If she were a boy, you'd know what to say, stuff about being brave and acting like a man. There's nothing a hearty slap on the back or a pub crawl can't fix, right? But somehow you don't think that'd go over too well in this situation.

You try to come up with things to say and even say a few of them. It seems to work. Sort of. She stops crying, but you wonder if she doesn't seem a bit disappointed at the same time. 

"Sir," she says, "Thank you again for rescuing me. My name is Jennifer, and I live on my family's farm a few miles from here. I'm injured and cannot walk, so I was wondering if you could help me back to my wagon?"

Dang it, women always muddle your thinking like this. As gently as you can, you help Jennifer to her feet and carry her to the wagon, which is just a little ways further up the road.

"Oh no..." Jennifer says. "The horse is missing."

In fact, SHOULDN'T you be glancing downward anyway for stray roots or stones in the road? A true gentleman is careful and would do nothing to trip and fall in this situation, wouldn't he?

Plus, with her dress torn, it's become rather revealing, and it would take a man of iron will to keep his eyes up for all this time. If you had to summon up so much willpower, you might get too tired, have to put her down, or God forbid, not be at your best if a confrontation with another traveler occurs.

Yes, not only can you not avoid looking at her boobs, you in fact MUST look at her boobs for the safety of everyone involved.

"Oh, shush," Jennifer says. "You have already impressed me enough today."

You do not use greaves, so your arms are already bare. Jennifer takes first your right and then your left, kneading them with hands surprisingly strong for such a small woman.
