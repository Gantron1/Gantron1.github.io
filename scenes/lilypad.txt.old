The foothills become steeper now, and the journey is slower without a path to follow.

In a short while, Tamara stops and thinks a moment.

"Wait here," she says. "I need to shake the dew from my lily pad."

She goes off into the forest by herself.

*label stealth
You wait a moment, then follow her, being as quiet as you can. You marvel at how quietly she's able to walk, never rustling leaves or grass, nor stepping on any twigs. Maybe she really is a master thief like she claims? You do your best to move quietly as well, and you are, for the most part, successful. At least, Tamara doesn't show any sign that she knows you've followed her.

Eventually, she stops, and you watch her from behind a tree a few dozen yards away.

She fumbles with her belt a little, then squats on the other side of a tree which partially obstructs your view of her. You can't really see much more than her left arm and shoulder.

You, creep, creep as close as you dare before stopping again, and you're now able to see her whole body from the rear and slightly to the left. You see that her leather pants are pulled down around her ankles, but unfortunately, a small bush is still obscuring the lower half of her body.

You continue being a creep and stealthily creep in a wide circle in order to see her without the bush obscuring your vision.

"Was the bush obscuring my bush?" Tamara says, making you freeze in your tracks. Dang, you've been caught.

Tamara, who had her belt pouch in her lap, puts something back in it, and moves the pouch out of the way. She spreads her legs, giving you full view of her "bush."

"There," she says. "Happy now?"

She quickly wipes with a clump of moss, stands, and pulls her pants up.

but . You hear Gabriella urinating gushily, holding the bag with the faerie in it as she does so. In short order, the sounds stops, and she extracts a few gems from the bag, careful not to let the faerie escape.

You can't see much from this distance, but it seems like she really might just be "shaking the dew off her lily pad."

She walks past you, resuming the journey, and you walk in silence for about an hour, making slow progress through the thick forest foliage.


*label waitpee
You wait, and you wait. It always seems a long time when you're waiting.

Finally, she returns, sees you, and says, "Good. I'm glad you didn't follow me in there to rape me when I had my pants down."

She smiles at her joke, and you realize it's the first time you've seen her smile. She's pretty when she does that, but the smile's woefully shortlived.

"Okay," she says, getting back down to business. "Maybe you can help me search for the witch. Are you with me? Are you going to become a witch hunter too? I'll give you a 25% cut of the bounty until you learn the trade, and then we can renegotiate. If you're pulling your own weight, we can make it 50/50. Deal?"

You've heard of witch hunters before, and it's a dangerous, though lucrative career. You'd never attempt it without training, but she seems to be offering to take you on as an apprentice. Judging by her gear and clothing, she seems to be doing quite well at it, so she must have skills. She seems sure of herself anyway.

She starts walking again, and after a few hours, as the sun begins to get lower in the sky, she says, "Well, this looks like a good place to make camp. You're my apprentice, so go gather a bunch of firewood. Then come back and rub my feet and shoulders."

You start gathering firewood, making a big pile that you have to keep coming back to, grumbling that it'd be much easier with two people because that way, one person can hold their arms out while the other loads it with sticks. It's much more efficient, but it seems like Gabriella wants to treat you like a slave. She's probably back there doing her nails or something, but still, you know how master and apprentices work. The apprentice is expected to do whatever the master wants, keyword: whatever. To pass the time, you fantasize about what it'd be like when you have an apprentice, and you hope it's a hot girl like Gabriella. You wonder what she was like when she was younger and just starting out, imagining all the ways she had to serve her master.

Finally, you have a pile that seems enough to last all night and bring it back to the campsite in only three trips. You wonder if Gabriella will be impressed by how much you manage to carry each time, but nope, she doesn't even seem to look up, just points at the circle of stones she's made.

"Okay, how about that back rub and foot rub?" Gabriella says once the fire's going well.

You start to knead her shoulders, and they're like steel springs, large for such a small-framed woman. You've got a good grip, but even so, you can barely squeeze them. It must be from all her training with the sword.

"Yeah, right there..." Gabriella says as you start to knead her tight thigh muscles. "Hey!"

She notices you looking at her boobs.

It got so intense that you squeezed her thigh muscles really hard.

"Yeah!" Gabriella exclaims. "Now you're putting your weight into it."

That's not all you want to put your weight into.

Slowly, the sun sets, and it gets colder.

You try to sleep, but it's no use. You can't stop thinking about Gabriella over there and how you want so badly to go climb into the bedroll with her. It's too embarrassing to masturbate, so you just lie there in agony. 

The minutes tick by slowly, the crackles of the fire marking time. One crackle. You're in agony. Two crackle. You're still in agony. Three crackle. Why did Gabriella insist on this professional relationship??? Four crackle. Maybe I really should quit. Five crackle. That does it! I'm gonna go out into the forest and masturbate.

You're about to sneak away, claiming you had to "shake dew off your lily pad" if she happens to notice, but you're pretty sure she's asleep. She hasn't moved in a long time. 

You carefully roll over to your side and are just beginning to slooooowly push yourself up to a sitting position when you hear Gabriella changing positions.

You lie there, eyes closed, listening. You can't tell what Gabriella's doing, but there's a lot of rustling of fabric as she's moving about. You can tell she's trying to be quiet, but still, you're able to hear a lot. Eventually the rustling sounds become rhythmic, like she's moving something under the covers in the same way again and again.

Unfortunately, you were facing the other way when you froze, so to see, you're going to have to roll over. You try to make it sound like you're just shifting in your sleep, but when you move, you hear all sound stop.

Carefully you slit one eye open, and you see Gabriella on the other side of the fire staring straight at you. You almost scream but hold it in, composing yourself, and resume studying the situation. You can't see much more than her upper body, so it looks like she's just lying there looking at you.

After a few moments when you don't move again, she turns away and closes her eyes. The rhythmic sound starts again, and you see that she has both arms under the covers, hands perhaps between her legs. It looks like she's pulling something towards her again and again.

Soon, the tempo increases, and she begins to move a little, shifting the position of her legs. Her back arches, and her head occasionally rolls from side to side. Finally, a soft moan escapes her lips.

*fake_choice
	#Stand up.
	#Masturbate too. She won't hear you, with all the noise she's making.
	#Force yourself to do nothing and just wait for it to be over.

"I'm ready to rethink this master/apprentice thing," you hear her say.

You're up in a flash and by her bedside.

"That was fast," she laughs. 

You see that she's spread her legs, one leg almost completely out of her bedroll. Her lower body is completely naked, and you can nearly see her crotch. She peels back the covers, and you see that she's hiked her shirt up (she's taken off the vest and is just sleeping in the white shirt she wears under it) over her breasts. Her sword is between her legs, the pommel almost entirely inside her. She pulls it out and shows it to you.

"See," she says, "I have a phallic-shaped pommel." 

You see that it indeed looks exactly like a penis, carved from ivory.

"I don't know why, but it gives me comfort in battle to grip it. It's like hugging an old friend."

She slips it back into herself and starts to move it in and out again.

"I do this alone just about every night," she says. "But now I have you."

She pulls the pommel out again, slides the sword up her body, and starts softly licking the glistening shaft.

"Does it make you hard? Do you want to be inside me?"

You climb on top of her, your member already rock-hard. It's been so for the last half-hour! It feels so good inside her already worked snatch, and you begin to work it some more.

"I just like to sleep with my sword," she says and quickly turns her back to you, hugging her sword like a teddy bear.

"Yes, now go to sleep," Gabriella says. "You're bothering me."

You go back to trying to sleep, and now, even the idea of sneaking off to masturbate is too embarrassing. You lie there ready to explode.

You hear Gabriella moving again.

You see Gabriella slowly moving her sword from where it was on the outside of her covers to under the covers. She glances over at you, sees you watching her, and sighs.

"Why are you watching me all night long?" she complains, gets up, and stalks off into the forest, taking her sword with her. 

"I'm going to pee," she says, "Want to watch that too? Don't answer that."

She takes a few steps, turns around, and says, "That question was completely rhetorical. I don't want you to watch me pee. Seriously, do not follow me."

She turns and stalks off into the forest, shaking her head.

You wait a little while, then, as quietly as you can, get up and follow Gabriella into the forest. It's dark, but the light of the moon guides your way. You can see her ghostly form making its way ahead of you.

She turns, sees you, but just keeps walking.

You keep following, and she keeps walking, eventually making a big circle. You arrive back at camp, and she climbs into bed.

"Good night," she says sullenly.

She's gone an awfully long time. Do you go check up on her?

*label checkup
You head off into the forest in the direction she was going when you last saw her, wondering if you'll even be able to find her in the dark. In a moment, you hear a sound and head toward it, and as you get closer, you realize that it's the leaves of a tree rustling rhythmically intermixed with the sound of deep breathing and soft moans.

You round a bend and come face to face with Gabriella, but somehow she's grown taller. Her face is a foot above you! She's completely nude and hanging onto the branches of a tree, her legs splayed apart, each foot on a low branch. Her sword is staked into the earth at the base of the tree, and she's riding the pommel of it, the tree branches shuddering with each bounce.

When she sees you she screams and tries to leap off, but the sword's still inside her, making her fall backwards instead. She lands hard on her buttocks and scrambles backwards with her legs to get the sword out of her.

"What are you doing here!" she demands, and even in the dim light of the half-moon, you see her turning red.

	#"Um... shaking the dew off my lily pad?"
	#"You were taking way too long, so I thought something happened."
	#"Let me finish the job!"
		
"Shut up and get down here!" Gabriella cries and grabs you by the waistband, pulling you on top of her. Her hands are scrambling to free your cock from your trousers.

"Get inside me before I change my mind," she says, finally pulling your swollen member free. 

She grabs your collar and pulls your head down for a passionate kiss while simultaneously wrapping her legs around your waist. Pulling with her legs and guiding your cock with one hand, it easily slips inside her.

"Ride me!" she screams.

*label bearnofollow
You wait for Gabriella to return, and just when you think it's been so long something MUST'VE happened, you see her finally come back into camp. She's quiet and seems pensive. She stands by her bedroll for awhile, staring out into the night, then glances at you.

"You awake?" she finally says.

*label stillsaynothing
You pretend to be asleep, watching Gabriella through slitted eyelids. She's standing by the fire, facing you fully now, just looking at you, wondering what she should do. After a minute or so, she tosses her sword on her bedroll, removes all her clothes, and is standing there naked, just in her knee-high leather boots.

She sidles over to you, steps over you with one foot, and kneels down, giving you a fantastic view of her pussy. Slowly, she moves it closer and closer to your face.

*label gabrielleappearance
The woman's perhaps 5'6" tall, slender but muscular. She's wearing tan, skin-tight corduroy breeches that does well to show off her shapely behind. Her boots are knee-high, fashioned from expensive leather, and she seems to have a custom-made padded leather vest that's a beautifully deep red color. It must've cost a fortune. 

Her breasts are small enough that they show no cleavage in the vest's neckline, but they are still a shapely pair. Her arms are bare, but she's wearing doe-skin gloves that go up to her elbows.

She has a backpack and belt pouch, and by her side is a slender, wicked-looking sword. A crossbow is draped over her back with quarrels at the ready.

Her hair's chestnut brown and falls to her shoulders. Her eyes are a piercing green, and when she looks at you, her intensity makes you nervous sometimes. You don't know if she's going to snap at you or simply turn away in disdain.

Are you nuts? This woman is beautiful, and not only that, in a way, you helped her catch the faerie. Maybe she owes you at least an explanation, if not even... "gratitude." Wink, wink.

Are you sure?

	#Really let her go.

I don't know why you just let her leave, but I suppose your reasons are your own. Maybe she gave you the creeps. Maybe you're afraid of hot women, but whatever your reason, you find yourself alone again and resume your journey.

*label journey
The path, no wider than an ox cart, continues its windy journey through Orlon Forest, rounding boulders and rock outcroppings here and there. You come to a point where the path takes a long detour, avoiding a small cliff with a drop of only ten feet or so, and you feel you could easily climb down, saving yourself a good ten minutes.

*choice
	#Climb down
		*goto climbdown
	#Stay on the path
		*goto staypath
	
*label climbdown
You easily climb down the small cliff, and nothing happens. No faerie waylaid you or anything. You didn't even slip. The path goes around simply because the road is used by farmers with their wagons, and you wonder just how serious the admonishment against leaving the path is.

*goto wagon

*label staypath
Better to be safe than sorry, for though you can see the path below, who knows what could happen. Not only might you slip, but you've heard that going off path is dangerous. The path's slope is gradual, and it shortly makes a hairpin turn, bringing you to the section you saw earlier.

*label wagon
In another ten minutes or so, you round a bend and see a wagon sitting in the middle of the road. It seems to be abandoned, its horse missing.
