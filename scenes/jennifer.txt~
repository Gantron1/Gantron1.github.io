She squeals and plants a kiss on your neck.

"Let's get out of here," Jennifer giggles furtively.

*page_break Go to the stream
*label stream2
With Jennifer guiding you, you first traverse the farm and then down a path into the small woods behind the back field where the kitchen herbs are growing. At first, Jennifer's little brothers and sisters follow, but they stop at the treeline. 

Alone again, Jennifer nestles her head against your chest. She's changed her dress, and her shin is wrapped with a bandage.

	There's a stillness here, a quietude, and you find it very peaceful, which makes you wonder why Jennifer didn't want to come this way. You wonder if she might enjoy it too, and you start to feel lonely.
	
Looking at the shrine a bit more, you see that it's built from river stones carefully placed in the maw of a great fallen oak tree. Around the stones are fresh flowers, showing that the altar has been recently tended, and at the base of the altar is a hollowed out stone with an offering of a strange red, viscous substance.

You go up to the altar and are about to bend to inspect it further when a familiar voice from behind your left ear startles you. It's Ella! 

"You may be friend of the fae," Ella says, "But that doesn't mean you can steal my raspberry pudding!" Her familiar laugh, link a tinkling bell, rings out through the trees. "I see you've had a full day, yes? Meeting two beauties of the human variety, and they're already fighting over you." She smiles approvingly, her eyes twinkling.

She floats over to the stone bowl and sits on its far edge, her legs straddling the rim, shamelessly showing you her entire womanhood in all its glory. As if unaware, she nonchalantly begins scooping the goop into her mouth with both hands until she's covered in the sticky goo.

"Oh," she says. "Sometimes I forget how humans think. The forest and the earth are one, I and the forest are one, the offering was to the earth mother, and so I get to eat it for her."

Ellas eyes become dreamy when she mentions the earth mother, and both her hands snake into her lap.

She presses her whole face into your frenulum, and you feel her tiny tongue whirling about this most erogenous of zones. Her wings beat rapidly, and she just about [i]buzzes[/i] up and down, almost faster than you can see, all the while her arms and legs stroking and moving, stimulating you in a way impossible to have imagined. 

She takes you almost to the point of orgasm but then gradually slows.

"Okay!" Ella exclaims and resumes her bodyjob, but now, she begins to fly up and down on your shaft at a much slower rate, keeping you just below the point of no return. The pleasure builds, and the need to finish becomes almost unbearable.

This is when Ella begins to rotate as well. Around and around, as well as up and down, she slides, and not only do you feel her touch, you feel the wind whipped up by her wings caressing your body. Her tongue, face, hair, breasts, legs, arms, hands, feet... everything is making spirals around your shaft, and her skin is so soft everywhere, softer than a human woman's softest places.

It's too much, and you begin to reach climax. You white goo spurts like a fountain above her and then cascades down Ella's whole body. She rises up, catches it with her hands and rubs it over her body while she wraps her legs around your shaft, humping it, rubbing her sex over your frenulum but staying away from the now over-sensitive head ridge.

*page_break Ella climaxes too!
Midway through your orgasm, Ella begins to reach her climax as well. Her pelvis begins to hump more forcefully until her whole body is bucking with spasms of its own. She can no longer pay attention to your spurts, too overwhelmed by the orgasmic sensations coursing through her body, and when they fly into her face, she just closes her eyes. Her cries of pleasure echo through the forest before both of you finally finish at the same time.

Ella lets herself slide down your still semi-hard shaft and sits at the base of it, lying back onto your stomach. Your swollen member between her legs covers her, and she holds it close to her chest. Once in awhile, she kisses it somewhere, igniting in you a memory of the pleasure that just was.

After resting like this for a few moments, Ella rolls onto her stomach, your cock flopping off to one side. 

"Will you clean me now?" she asks, using her little girl voice again, making the big eyes.

Ella lies down on the ${naturebed}, and you, on your hands and knees, move over her, running your tongue up and down her body in long, slow strokes. 

"Yesssss..." Ella says, elongating her body and rolling first to one side, then back again, letting your tongue find new paths to travel. 

You start at her feet, cover both legs at once, then her sex, her stomach, her breasts, her neck, and then her whole face. She turns over, and your tongue moves over her heels, calves, thighs, buttocks, back, neck, and head. You take each arm into your mouth, then each leg, and you can envelope almost her entire limb. You feel them slip down your throat briefly but do not gag. 

Ella spreads her legs and you lick between them until it's clean. You lick between her breasts, her cheeks. You take her whole head in your mouth, and press your tongue into her tiny eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth.

Finally, she's clean, her body glistening, your saliva turned into ethereal sheen.

"Thank you," she says. "The other faeries just don't know what they're missing!"

She rolls to one side and languidly rises to a sitting position.

"But really," she goes on, "It's only a special human who can do what you just did. Most cannot even see us. Rebekah can, but she's never touched one of us. We straddle the two worlds."

Her wings begin to beat, and Ella rises.

"Until we meet again, friend human," she says and zips off into the forest.

"I meant to do that," she says.

Then she steps into the bowl and kneels, arms to either side supporting herself on the bowl's rim, and begins to slide all parts of her body up and down the inside of the bowl, smearing herself with raspberry residue. You watch her rhythmic movements mesmerized.

Finally, she sits in the middle of the bowl, knees to her chest and arms wrapped around.

"Now I offer myself to you, god of the forest. Come and take me."

Reverently you approach the stone bowl and reach in, scooping Ella out of it, and you find she's as light as a feather, even when her wings aren't moving, as if she were a being more ephemeral than physical.

Almost like a flower, she blossoms in you hands, and leans back, grasping one of your fingers with each of her hands and spreads her legs, placing a foot on each of your forearms.

Ella runs her hands up and down her body, smearing the red goo everywhere.

Let my touch wash away your anger, and you can return to her with a positive mind. There may be a rivalry between the sisters if you indulge with one in another's presence, but in general, even humans no longer begrudge another the sacred union if discretion is maintained. Long ago, you did. Isn't that silly? You had funny customs like marriage, monogamy, and cheating."
